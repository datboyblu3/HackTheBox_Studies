#### Static Libraries
- Denoted by .a extension
- cannot be altered when compiled
#### Dynamically Linked Libraries
- denoted by .so extension
- can be modified to control the execution of the program that calls them

#### Specifying the locations of dlls
- Environment variables `LD_RUN_PATH`,  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`
- placing them in default directories /lib or /usr/lib
- specifying another directory containing the libraries within theÂ `/etc/ld.so.conf`
#### List all libraries required by /bin/ls
```
ldd /bin/ls
```

### Using LD_PRELOAD to Priv Esc
- Need a sudo user
